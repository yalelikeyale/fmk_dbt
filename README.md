# **FMK DBT Demo**

## **Support Requests**:

## **Feature Requests**:

!!if we can support a heap-starter package and a heap helper package we could offer continued support via these packages!!! hands on support for new explores or reports etc would require ps units which would fall into the queue unless you wanted to purchase a fast pass. more support than that we'd recommend that this be part of a kickoff for an engagement with a partner.

What macros could we provide that would solve common requests like sessionizaiton, user-stitching, defined properties, etc

goals for project:
 - get project framework done in prep for drf 
 - try creating it in a way where as much of it as possible can be useful in other projects that aren't drf whether that means heavy use of variables or naming conventions with customer in name that needs to be replaced? 
 - heavy use of macros

goals for today: 
 - get barebones sql done
 - study audit helper and utilities
